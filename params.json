[Here's](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jd9ufeuqycfphbx/Note-code-s-version.pdf?dl=0) the paper we submitted.\r\n\r\n###Description\r\n[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vj5wrkuiszseh04/notes.pdf?dl=0) is also a pdf containing instructions and detailed description of using the existing prototype, currently available at this repo.\r\n\r\nNote Code was built as a constructionist environment that allows making musical tunes using computational concepts, and enables learning computational thinking at the same time. It also includes a puzzle-guided learning region that is accessible through the coupled GUI â€“ this involves creating tunes that are presented as a puzzle, which require figuring out different functionalities and abilities in programming techniques. \r\n\r\nHere is a video demonstrating the GUI's working:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9cu4-8tGxI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n![Note Box](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9eogrsol8zcfczz/Box.png)\r\n\r\n![Testing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wvx26swh2kf85xp/Testing.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
